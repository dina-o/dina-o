### Hello Reader! ✨✨✨

This is Dina's (aka me :D) Den of Development!

I've always been a curious learner- going down article and YouTube rabbit holes at midnight about almost anything you can think of! That's why I love Systems Design Engineering. It is so multidisciplinary and I have so many opportunities to try out different focuses before I figure out my exact path in tech. During hackathons or other STEM competitions, I try to acquire new skills from trial/error and through my own teammates! CSS, HTML, UX/UI design are a couple of skills I've picked up solely through these events!

I'm currently looking for Winter 2024 internships in frontend development or product management -- if you would like to discuss opportunities feel free to shoot me a message at **dina.oorucevic@gmail.com** 💌💌💌

When I'm not learning about cool new tech, you can catch me... 
- binge reading novels
- at dog parks, obsessing over corgis (even though I don't own one)
- snapping film photos
- daydreaming about travelling 🗺️✈️

### thank you for stopping by!
